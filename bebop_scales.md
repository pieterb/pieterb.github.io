## Exploring all possible bebop scales

two approaches:

1.  starting from parent scales and modes, explore and evaluate all possible chromatic extensions.
2.  starting from all possible chromatic extensions, explore and evaluate what it gives us.

this article takes three steps:

1.  exhaustively list all theoretically possible chromatically extensions to all parent scales. Builds vocabulary for the rest of the article.
2.  start with first approach: given each scale/mode, explore valuable chromatic extensions.
3.  proceed with second approach: given each possible bebop scale, explore the chords and modes that can be articulated with it and see if we've missed anything.

## How many bebop scales can we build, anyway?

This articles explores octatonic bebop scales formed by adding a chromatic extension note each of the three most commonly used heptatonic parent scales: major, melodic minor, and harmonic minor. The octave being divided into 12 half-tone steps, each heptatonic scale has 5 “gaps” that can hold chromatic extension notes.

Let’s start with the major scale, with intervals 2-2-1-2-2-2-1. In the key of C, this scale has notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-c, all the white keys on the piano. This scale has five gaps, corresponding to all the black keys of the piano: D♭, E♭, G♭, A♭, and B♭. Adding each of these notes to the major scale, we get 5 new scales:

| Chromatic<br/>note | 1 | ♭2 | 2 | ♭3 | 3 | 4 | ♭5 | 5 | ♭6 | 6 | ♭7 | 7 | Scale<br/>name |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| ♭2 | X | O | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X |   | O | S1 |
| ♭3 | X |   | O | X | O | X |   | O |   | X |   | O | S2 |
| ♭5 | X |   | O |   | X | O | X | O |   | X |   | O | S3 |
| ♭6 | X |   | O |   | X | O |   | X | O | X |   | O | S4 |
| ♭7 | X |   | O |   | X | O |   | X |   | O | X | O | S3 (duplicate) |

The rightmost column — Scale name — defines a name for each of these scales, that we use throughout the rest of this article. The first four scales are unique: they each have a unique interval sequence. The fifth scale, however, can be considered a mode of the third scale. So our excercise of adding a single chromatic note to the major scale yields 4 unique new bebop scales, which I’ll call S1, S2, S3, and S4 in the remainder of this article.

Let’s do the same for the melodic minor scale:

| Chromatic<br/>extension | 1 | ♭2 | 2 | ♭3 | 3 | 4 | ♭5 | 5 | ♭6 | 6 | ♭7 | 7 | Scale<br/>name |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| ♭2 | X | O | X | O |   | X |   | O |   | X |   | O | S5 |
|  3 | X |   | O | X | O | X |   | O |   | X |   | O | S2 (duplicate) |
| ♭5 | X |   | O | X |   | O | X | O |   | X |   | O | S6 |
| ♭6 | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X | O | X |   | O | S7 |
| ♭7 | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X |   | O | X | O | S1 (duplicate) |

Again, we fill each of the five gaps, and this time we yield 3 more unique scales. Adding a major 3rd or flat 7th results in inversions of S2 and S1, respectively.

Finally, let’s extend the harmonic minor scale:

| Chromatic<br/>extension | 1 | ♭2 | 2 | ♭3 | 3 | 4 | ♭5 | 5 | ♭6 | 6 | ♭7 | 7 | Scale<br/>name |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| ♭2 | X | O | X | O |   | X |   | O | X |   |   | O | S8  |
|  3 | X |   | O | X | O | X |   | O | X |   |   | O | S9  |
| ♭5 | X |   | O | X |   | O | X | O | X |   |   | O | S10 |
|  6 | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X | O | X |   | O | S7 (duplicate) |
| ♭7 | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X | O |   | X | O | S4 (duplicate) |

This gives us 3 new unique scales, which I’ll label S8, S9 and S10.

So, by adding chromatic extension notes to the three common heptatonic scales, we can construct 10 different octatonic bebob scales. That’s good to know, I guess. Now, we could investigate what each of the 8 modes of these 10 scales (80 in total!) can articulate, and I'll do so later on. But I’ll start with a different approach.

## Adding chromatic extensions to existing Jazz modes

Let’s take a step back and look at the original 3 heptatonic parent scales (major, melodic minor, and harmonic minor), each 7 modes. These scale-modes (21 in total, but some are exotic and non-idiomatic to jazz) are commonly used within a specific harmonic context. For example, the major scale (more precisely its first mode, Ionian) is commonly used in a major tonic context. This could be a ⅠMa7 in a Ⅱm7–Ⅴ7–ⅠMa7 progression, but also a plain Ⅰ major triad, a Ⅰ<sup>6</sup><sub>9</sub> chord, or a ⅠMa9 chord.

So, how would each of the 5 possible chromatic extensions of the major scale help articulate different harmonic contexts? Putting the extension note on the off-beat, each extension notes gives a different arpeggio on the down-beats:

| Chromatic<br/>extension | Resulting arpeggio |
| ---: | :--- |
| ♭2 | 1–2–4–6 |
| ♭3 | 3–5–Ma7–9 |
| ♭5 | 5–Ma7–9–11 |
| ♭6 | 1–3–5–6 |
| ♭7 | Ma7–9–11–13 |


### Modes of the major scale

### Modes of the melodic minor scale

### Modes of the harmonic minor scale

## Showdown of all bebop scales

## Conclusions

1.  By adding chromatic extension notes to the three common heptatonic scales, we can construct 10 different octatonic bebob scales.
