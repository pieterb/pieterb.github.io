## Exploring all possible bebop scales

two approaches:

1.  starting from parent scales and modes, explore and evaluate all possible chromatic extensions.
2.  starting from all possible chromatic extensions, explore and evaluate what it gives us.

this article takes three steps:

1.  exhaustively list all theoretically possible chromatically extensions to all parent scales. Builds vocabulary for the rest of the article.
2.  start with first approach: given each scale/mode, explore valuable chromatic extensions.
3.  proceed with second approach: given each possible bebop scale, explore the chords and modes that can be articulated with it and see if we've missed anything.

## How many bebop scales can we build, anyway?

This articles explores octatonic bebop scales formed by adding a chromatic extension note each of the three most commonly used heptatonic parent scales: major, melodic minor, and harmonic minor. The octave being divided into 12 half-tone steps, each heptatonic scale has 5 “gaps” that can hold chromatic extension notes.

Let’s start with the major scale, with intervals 2-2-1-2-2-2-1. In the key of C, this scale has notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-c, all the white keys on the piano. This scale has five gaps, corresponding to all the black keys of the piano: D♭, E♭, G♭, A♭, and B♭. Adding each of these notes as off-beat passing notes to the major scale, we get 5 new scales:

| Chromatic<br/>note | 1 | ♭2 | 2 | ♭3 | 3 | 4 | ♭5 | 5 | ♭6 | 6 | ♭7 | 7 | Scale<br/>name |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| ♭2 | O | X | O |   | X | O |   | X |   | O |   | X | S1a |
| ♭3 | X |   | O | X | O | X |   | O |   | X |   | O | S2a |
| ♭5 | O |   | X |   | O | X | O | X |   | O |   | X | S3a |
| ♭6 | X |   | O |   | X | O |   | X | O | X |   | O | S4a |
| ♭7 | O |   | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X | O | X | S3b |

Bebob scales are about rhythm, and putting certain notes on the beat, and others off-beat. In this table, the “O”s are on-beat notes, and the “X”s are off-beat notes.

The rightmost column — Scale name — labels each of these scales, and I’ll use these labels throughout the remainder of this article.

The first four scales in the table have unique interval sequences. The fifth scale has the same interval sequence as the third scale —starting from its perfect 5th— with the on-beat and off-beat notes inverted. In this article, I’ll call these scales *rhythmic inversions* of each other, and label them distinctly as “a” or “b”. In this case, the two scales have been labeled “S3a” and “S3b”.

So our excercise of adding a single chromatic off-beat passing note to the major scale yields 5 unique new bebop scales.

Let’s do the same for the melodic minor scale:

| Chromatic<br/>extension | 1 | ♭2 | 2 | ♭3 | 3 | 4 | ♭5 | 5 | ♭6 | 6 | ♭7 | 7 | Scale<br/>name |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| ♭2 | O | X | O | X |   | O |   | X |   | O |   | X | S5a |
|  3 | O |   | X | O | X | O |   | X |   | O |   | X | S2b |
| ♭5 | X |   | O | X |   | O | X | O |   | X |   | O | S6a |
| ♭6 | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X | O | X |   | O | S7a |
| ♭7 | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X |   | O | X | O | S1b |

This time we yield 3 more unique interval sequences (S5a, S6a, S7a) and 2 rhythmic inversions of interval sequences we’ve seen before: S1b (rhythmic inversion of S1a) and S2b (rhythmic inversion of S2a).

Finally, let’s extend the harmonic minor scale:

| Chromatic<br/>extension | 1 | ♭2 | 2 | ♭3 | 3 | 4 | ♭5 | 5 | ♭6 | 6 | ♭7 | 7 | Scale<br/>name |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| ♭2 | X | O | X | O |   | X |   | O | X |   |   | O | S8a  |
|  3 | X |   | O | X | O | X |   | O | X |   |   | O | S9a  |
| ♭5 | X |   | O | X |   | O | X | O | X |   |   | O | S10a |
|  6 | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X | O | X |   | O | S7b |
| ♭7 | X |   | O | X |   | O |   | X | O |   | X | O | S4b |

Just as when extending the melodic minor scale, we yield 3 more unique interval sequences (S8a, S9a, S10a) and 2 rhythmic inversions of interval sequences we’ve seen before: S4b (rhythmic inversion of S4a) and S7b (rhythmic inversion of S7a).

So, by adding chromatic extension notes to the three common heptatonic scales, we can construct 15 different octatonic bebob scales, built from 10 unique interval sequences. That’s good to know, I guess. Now, we could investigate what each of the 8 modes of these 10 scales (80 in total!) can articulate, and I'll do so later on. But I’ll start with a different approach.

## Adding chromatic extensions to existing Jazz modes

Let’s take a step back and look at the original 3 heptatonic parent scales (major, melodic minor, and harmonic minor), each 7 modes. These scale-modes (21 in total, but some are exotic and non-idiomatic to jazz) are commonly used within a specific harmonic context. For example, the major scale (more precisely its first mode, Ionian) is commonly used in a major tonic context. This could be a ⅠMa7 in a Ⅱm7–Ⅴ7–ⅠMa7 progression, but also a plain Ⅰ major triad, a Ⅰ<sup>6</sup><sub>9</sub> chord, or a ⅠMa9 chord.

In this section, I’ll investigate how adding chromatic extension notes to our heptatonic scales and modes articulate different harmonic contexts.

### Modes of the major scale

The seven modes of the major scale are:

1.  Ionian
2.  Dorian
3.  Phrygian
4.  Lydian
5.  Mixolydian
6.  Aeolian
7.  Locrian

When adding off-beat chromatic extension notes to the Ionian mode, we create the following on-beat arpeggio's:

| Chromatic<br/>extension | Resulting arpeggio | Comment |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| ♭2 | 1–9–11–13 | The natural 11 in a major context is rare; suggests Ⅱm7 subdominant chord. |
| ♭3 | 3–5–Ma7–9 | A nice 3-to-9 arpeggio suggesting a Ma9 chord |
| ♭5 | 4-5–Ma7–9 | The natural 4 suggests a Ma7sus4 chord. |
| ♭6 | 1–3–5–6 | The natural 6 adds little color; suggests plain major triad. |
| ♭7 | Ma7–9–11–13 | Very colorful; suggests Ⅶø7 |




### Modes of the melodic minor scale

### Modes of the harmonic minor scale

## Showdown of all bebop scales

## Conclusions

1.  By adding chromatic extension notes to the three common heptatonic scales, we can construct 10 different octatonic bebob scales.
