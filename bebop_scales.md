## What is a bebop scale?

- [ ] the purpose of bebop scales: rhythm
- [ ] applicable parent scales
- [ ] formal definition

## Common bebop scales

- [ ] “the” bebop scale: mixolydian
- [ ] two Dorian bebop scales
- [ ] Why these scales?

## Exploring all possible bebop scales

two approaches:

1.  starting from parent scales and modes, explore and evaluate all possible chromatic extensions.
2.  starting from all possible chromatic extensions, explore and evaluate what it gives us.

this article takes three steps:

1.  exhaustively list all theoretically possible chromatically extensions to all parent scales. Builds vocabulary for the rest of the article.
2.  start with first approach: given each scale/mode, explore valuable chromatic extensions.
3.  proceed with second approach: given each possible bebop scale, explore the chords and modes that can be articulated with it and see if we've missed anything.

## How many bebop scales can we build, anyway?

This articles explores octatonic bebop scales formed by adding a chromatic extension note each of the three most commonly used heptatonic parent scales: major, melodic minor, and harmonic minor. The octave being divided into 12 half-tone steps, each heptatonic scale has 5 “gaps” that can hold chromatic extension notes.

Let’s start with the major scale, with intervals 2-2-1-2-2-2-1. In the key of C, this scale has notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-c, all the white keys on the piano. This scale has five gaps, corresponding to all the black keys of the piano: D♭, E♭, G♭, A♭, and B♭. Adding each of these notes to the major scale, we get 5 new scales:
