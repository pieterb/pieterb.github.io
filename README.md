# Ultimate Analysis and Synthesis of Bebop Scales

## What is a bebop scale?

- [ ] the purpose of bebop scales: rhythm
- [ ] applicable parent scales
- [ ] formal definition

## Common bebop scales

- [ ] “the” bebop scale: mixolydian
- [ ] two Dorian bebop scales
- [ ] Why these scales?

## Exploring all possible bebop scales

- [ ] two approaches:
    # starting from parent scales and modes, explore and evaluate all possible chromatic extensions.
    # starting from all possible chromatic extensions, explore and evaluate what it gives us.
- [ ] this article takes three steps:
    # exhaustively list all theoretically possible chromatically extensions to all parent scales. Builds vocabulary for the rest of the article.
    # start with first approach: given each scale/mode, explore valuable chromatic extensions.
    # proceed with second approach: given each possible bebop scale, explore the chords and modes that can be articulated with it and see if we've missed anything.
